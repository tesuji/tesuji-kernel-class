    description: |
      Lectures can be graded by embedding them as challenges!
      This is a demonstration of this capability.

      Graded lectures are actually custom challenges with a custom interface.
      The challenge runs a special docker container, and the way to configure it is to include a .config file containing the youtube ID for the video and the duration in seconds that must be watched before the flag is given.
